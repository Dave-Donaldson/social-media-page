# social-media-page

I recreated this social media page using only HTML and CSS (SASS). I wanted to make sure I was fully capable of making a complex page using only HTML/CSS before using frameworks and this helped me tremendously grasp moving elements around the screen using padding and margin. Please enjoy as I put alot of time and effort in making this early on in my learning. I have since moved on to Javascript and javascript frameworks to create more dynamic websites.
